Technology transfer helps to develop early stage intellectual property into tools for direct use by the research community, or into bases for new platforms, products, or services to be made into products for public use. Successful collaborations are formed between researchers across different universities or industries in order to advance the knowledge in a particular field or to further develop a technology. These collaborations may result in licensing or sponsored research opportunities that benefit both partners. In addition, technology transfer ensures that the interests and rights of the university in the intellectual property are protected. The university is able to retain the intellectual property rights of the technology and issue a license for the conditional use of the technology.", "marks": "6"},
