{"question": "What is the impact of indoor pollution on health?", "answer": " indoor pollution can have various impacts on health. There is strong evidence linking indoor pollution to acute respiratory infections, chronic obstructive lung disease, and lung cancer. Moderate evidence suggests a link between indoor pollution and cataracts and tuberculosis, while limited evidence suggests a link with asthma. However, there is insufficient evidence to link indoor pollution with low birth weight, perinatal deaths, and heart disease. The extent to which indoor air pollutants impact health depends on the degree of pollution, the degree of exposure, and personal susceptibility to the effects of indoor air pollutants. Technical interventions such as improved stoves, improved fuels, fuel switching, chimneys, flues, hoods, ventilation, and reducing cooking time and modifying cooking practices can help reduce indoor air pollutants.", "marks": "4"},
{"question": "What is the environmental impact of energy sources?", "answer": "The text mentions several types of energy sources and their associated environmental impacts. For example, household combustion of coal or biomass can cause emission hazards, with solid fuels burned in inefficient stoves and poorly ventilated conditions leading to significant disease burdens, particularly in populations with inadequate access to clean fuels. Automotive pollution from exhaust gas or flue gas emitted during the combustion of fuels such as natural gas, gasoline/petrol, diesel fuel, fuel oil, or coal contributes to air pollution and is a major ingredient in the creation of smog in some large cities. Nuclear hazard is another significant environmental impact of energy sources, with nuclear explosions injecting substantial amounts of radioactivity into the environment. Radioactive substances are among the most toxic substances known, and the radioactive waste from nuclear plants may be in the form of gases, liquids, or solids, with no suitable and cheap method of storing the radioactive waste. Toxic materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium are also used in many types of batteries, and when each battery reaches the end of its life, it must be disposed of to prevent environmental damage. Overall, the environmental impact of energy sources can be significant and varied, with different types of energy sources having different impacts on the environment.", "marks": "6"},

{"question": "Why are women most exposed to indoor air pollution?", "answer": "Women and their youngest children are most exposed because of their household roles.", "marks": "2"},
{"question": "What can cause indoor pollution?", "answer": "indoor pollution can be caused by various factors, including: 1. Household combustion of coal or biomass (e.g., dung, charcoal, wood, crop residues) used for household cooking and heating. Solid fuels are burned in inefficient simple stoves and in poorly ventilated conditions, leading to significant disease burdens, particularly in populations with inadequate access to clean fuels, particularly poor households in rural areas of developing countries. 2. Automotive pollution, which is emitted as a result of the combustion of fuels such as natural gas, gasoline/petrol, diesel fuel, fuel oil, or coal. Motor vehicle emissions contribute to air pollution and are a major ingredient in the creation of smog in some large cities. 3. Battery hazards, as many types of batteries employ toxic materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium as an electrode or electrolyte. When each battery reaches the end of its life, it must be disposed of to prevent environmental damage.", "marks": "4"},
{"question": "How does the environment affect the health of people?", "answer": "The text provides several examples of how the environment can affect the health of people.

{"question": "What is the best way to prevent a battery explosion?", "answer": "The best way to prevent a battery explosion is to handle batteries properly and avoid misuse or malfunction. For example, do not attempt to recharge a primary (non-rechargeable) battery, and avoid short circuits. Car batteries are most likely to explode when a short-circuit generates very large currents. Car batteries produce hydrogen, which is very explosive, when they are overcharged (because of electrolysis of the water in the electrolyte). When a battery is recharged at an excessive rate, an explosive gas mixture of hydrogen and oxygen may be produced faster than it can escape from within the battery, leading to pressure build-up and eventual bursting of the battery case. It is also important to turn off the charger, vent the house, and stay outside until the odor of hydrogen sulfide (which comes after overcharging batteries) disappears.", "marks": "4"},

Eye contact can cause permanent blindness; swallowing damages internal organs that can lead to death. First aid treatment calls for flushing the skin for 10 to 15 minutes with large amounts of water to cool the affected tissues and to prevent secondary damage. Immediately remove contaminated clothing and thoroughly wash the underlying skin. Always wear protective equipment when handling the sulfuric acid.
