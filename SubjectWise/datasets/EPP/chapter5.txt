Intellectual Property Rights 
 

Intellectual property is a right you have on your creations, like a film, a musical composition, an invention, a brand name, etc. Like any other real property, you have the right to own and protect the creations of your mind. Such a right is called intellectual property. If you have an intellectual property (IP) over any of 
your work or ideas, others need to take your permission before using it. Otherwise you can initiate legal action against such persons.  
Intellectual property refers to the right over the intellectual work and not the work itself. The work can be either artistic or commercial. The artistic works come under the category of copyright laws, while the commercial ones, also known as industrial properties, are ruled by patents, trademarks and industrial design rights. Copyright laws deal with the intellectual property of creative works like books, music, software, painting, etc. Industrial properties cover those created and used for industrial or commercial purposes. As stated earlier, intellectual property is categorized into various types as per the nature of work. The most common types of intellectual property are copyrights,trademarks,patentsandindustrialdesignrights.                                                                                                 
Copyrights 
A copyright is a right conferred on the owner of a literary or artistic work. It is an exclusive right to control the publication, distribution and adaptation of creative works. The right lies with the owner-cum-copyright holder for a certain period of time. As time lapses, the work can be republished or reproduced by others. Usually, the timespan of a copyright extends through the entire life of the owner and lasts up to a period of about 50 to100 years after death. In case of anonymous works, the right lasts for 95 years after publication or 120 years after the creation.  
Trademarks 
A trademark is a symbol, which is generally used to identify a particular product, which indicates its source. A trademark can be a combination of words, phrases, symbols, logos, designs, images or devices, used by an individual, legal entity or business organization to distinguish their products from that of others. For example, you can identify the products of Nike Inc., through their logo, which is embossed on their products. Once registered, trademarks are protected legally and the owners can sue persons who use their trademarks. Patents 
Patents are rights related to new inventions. This right is conferred on persons who invent any new machine, process, article of manufacture or composition of matter, biological discoveries, etc. In order to grant a patent, the invention should fit into the following criteria, which may differ from country to country. In general, the invention must be new, inventive and should be useful or can be applied in industries. The person who receives a patent for his invention has an exclusive right to control others from making, using, selling, or distributing the patented invention without permission. Generally, the time limit of a patent is 20 years from the date of filing the application (for the patent) Industrial Design 
These rights also come under intellectual property and protect the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian, but have an aesthetic or ornamental value. It can refer to the creation of a shape, color, pattern or a combination of all these things. It can be an industrial commodity or a handicraft. The design can be either two-dimensional (based on pattern, colors and lines) or three-dimensional (as per shape and surface). An industrial design right is conferred after considering factors like, novelty, originality and visual appeal. The person who has an industrial design right has the exclusive right to make or sell any objects in which the design is applicable.                   The right is conferred for a period of 10 to 25 years. Copyright: (Copy right act 2022 has been repealed and Copyright act 2059 prevail)  
Copyright generally means the sole right to produce or reproduce the work or any substantial part thereof in any material form whatever. Subject to provision of copyright act, copyright exist in every original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work.  
The basic principle of copyright is that a person or a group of people has the sole right of physical and intellectual ownership to any work that is in it a “unique work of art” created by the person or a group of people.  
 
The concept of copyright can be broken down into three basic areas. 
• Attribution (Credited) and integrity (Unchanged): The author of the work has the right to have his name attributed to the work when it is published, quoted or otherwise displayed. The integrity of the work shall be maintained unchanged unless the author gives explicit permission. 
• Ownership, reproduction and distribution: For technical and economic reasons it has been customary for authors to share the rights of commercial exploitation or their work with publishers either by employment or contract. 
• Display and performance: Rights associated with unique creativity in performance interpretation and display. 
Having created a unique work, two elementary aspects of responsibility follow specially in situations where conflicting claims need to be resolved. 
• Income and compensation: There are numerous examples of vast sums being awarded in compensation for lost income because a work has been illegally copied and distributed. 
Legal liability: Claims for offensive creation such as defamation of character, personal injury, lost income and infringement of copyright etc. It is quite normal for many professions such as law, medicine, engineering and the journalistic media to retain insurance policies in case of claims against professional negligence. 
 
Ownership of copyright and his rights : 
• Acquisition of ownership of copyright: Any person registering any of his work shall have the copyright in accordance with the provision of copyright act. The right to have the copyright of any work registered shall vest only in the author of the work except few conditions.

Any person who desires to register any work shall apply to the office of the registrar giving such particulars as have been prescribed together with evidence of his ownership in such copyright; such application shall accompany the prescribed registration fee. Term of copyright 
The copyright in any work subsists during the lifetime of the author and shall continue for fifty years after his death. 
Provision regarding license of copyright: 
• Grant of license of copyright holder: Incase any owner of the copyright grants license to publish whole or part of such work, the licensee shall be entitled to publish suck work in accordance with the conditions of the license only. 
• Grant of license by registrar: Incase any work, which has once been published for the public, is required in the interest of public to be published again, and the owner of the copyright fails to publish and also refuse to grant permission to any other person for such publication, the registrar may grant license to any other person. 
• License for translation: Publication of translation of work rendered into Nepali may grant such license provided that such license shall not be deemed to bestow sole ownership on the translator. 
• License of public exhibition: Registrar may grant general or special license for public exhibition after specifying the necessary conditions. 
• License of public library: Registrar may, for the purpose of keeping such copy in the library, grant license for the reproduction of whole or any specified portion of the work. 
Unauthorized publication and punishment:

Provided that any publication made in the following circumstances shall not be deemed to be an unauthorized publication.

NBC 000 categorizes design and construction of buildings into four types according to their level of sophistication. (Classification of building codes) 
a) International state of art 
 The major thrust of the code is aimed at the typical and most common buildings currentlybeing constructed in Nepal. It does not suggest as being practical for everyday considerationthe sophisticated design philosophies and analytical techniques that appear in the buildingcodes of developed countries. Under the first category International State-of-the-Art, ifconsultants ensure that their designs meet the corresponding international standard, thedesigns are considered to be in conformity with NBC.  b) Professionally engineered building 
  It covers all usual structures such as hospitals,meetings halls, factories, warehouses, multi-storey buildings and residential buildings.Building having plinth area more than 1000 S.ft., more than 3 storied and structural span of more than 4.5 m which will be constructed under design and supervision of engineer fall in this category.  
c) Buildings of restricted size designed with simpleRules-of-Thumb  - Mandatory rules of thumb (MRT) It refers to Buildings of restricted size designed with simple Rules-of-Thumb, and mostly applies to remote areas where simpler buildings are prominent.The explanatory documents are such that an experienced overseer will be able to understandthem and present sufficient details at the time of permit application to prove to a skilledappraiser at the Local Authority that the requirements have been met. 
The requirements are interms of limits on spans and heights, minimum reinforcing and member sizes, positioning ofearthquake-resisting elements and other such rules. 
  Simple buildings that are constructed, where professional engineers and technicians are not available, under supervision of middle level technicians of which plinth area  is less than 1000 Sq. ft. , less than 3 storied and structural span less than 4.5 m fall in this category. NBC 201,202 and 205 are applicable for buildings under this category and the codes deals with Mandatory Rules of thumb (MRT) reinforced concrete building with masonry infill, mandatory rules of thumb load bearing masonry and MRT reinforced concrete building without masonry infill respectively. 
d) Guidelines for remote rural building 
 These guidelines addressabout a dozen typical building styles that have been condensed from an inventory ofapproximately fifty-five building types surveyed in 1993. In the form of diagrams anddescriptions aimed at technical advisors, house owners and lay-men, these guidelinesemphasize those changes that should be made to current practices to improve the seismicresistance of these buildings not subject to modern quantitative analysis and rational designconsideration. These structures are normally of earthen construction (e.g. unburned masonry,mud-mortar, rubble, dry stone, wattle and daub). Whereas these recommendations aredescribed as guidelines, it is intended to be mandatory for such structures built in areascontrolled by a building permit-issuing local authority. 
 Simple buildings having less than two storied that are constructed in remote rural areas, where control is impractical because of non-availability of regular technical supervision fall under this  category and implemented NBC codes are as mentioned below: 
 NBC 203 : Guidelines for earthquake resistance building construction: Low strength masonry  NBC 204 : Guidelines for earthquake resistance building construction: Earthen building 
 
Building act has directed to comply with the building codes while constructing a building by any persons, institutions or public entities. Similarly, it is also mandatory to have building permission from concerned valley Development Corporation, urban development office, metropolitan or sub metropolitan city, municipal office.  
 
Building bylaws 
It is the set of guidelines regarding the design of buildings, orderly and systematic planning of the area and ensure safety standards. These are prepared by concerned town development committees and are followed by the municipalities of the country. Building bylaws are prepared to ensure public health and safety, planned urban development and planned built environment. With rapid growing urbanization and increase in population, it  
becomes an important tool & mechanism for the controlling of growth and development of the cities. Building codes & bylaws provide the regulations and standards that architects, builders and owners must meet while designing , constructing or remodeling buildings. It specify the minimum acceptable level of safety for constructed objects such as buildings and non- building structures. 
Objectives of  bylaws 
• To design & construct the building as per climatology, topography, acoustic & thermal aspect 
• To develop necessary physical infrastructure 
• To use new land for future expansion 
• To maintain & show civilization 
• To create comfort living standards 
• To conserve & develop socio economic, cultural, architectural & historical values 
 
Basic components of building bylaws 
a) Building   	b) Planning  	c) Enforcement 
Elements of the building bylaws in Building segment 
    • Right of Way(ROW) 
A right-of-way is a right to make a way over a piece of land, usually to and from another piece of land. A right of way is a type of easement granted or reserved over the land for transportation purposes, such as for a footway, carriageway, trail, driveway, rail line or highway. A right-of-way is reserved for the purposes of maintenance or expansion of existing services with the right-of-way. In the case of an easement, it may revert to its original owners if the facility is abandoned. 
    • Set Back 
In land use, a setback is the distance which a building or other structure is set back from a street or road, a river or other stream, a shore or flood plain, or any other place which is deemed to need protection. Depending on the jurisdiction, other things like fences, landscaping, septic tanks, and various potential hazards or nuisances might be regulated. Setbacks are generally set in municipalordinances or zoning. 
    • Floor Area Ratio(FAR) 
Floor area ratio (FAR), floor space ratio (FSR), floor space index (FSI), site ratio and plot ratio are all terms for the ratio of a building's total floor area to the size of the piece of land upon which it is built. The terms can also refer to limits imposed on such a ratio. 
As a formula: Floor area ratio = (total covered area on all floors of all buildings on a certain plot)/(area of the plot) 
    • Ground Coverage Ratio(GCR) 
    • Height of the building 
    • Guidelines for cultural heritage zone 
    • Clearance required for important sites and from other elements Elements of Building bylaws in Planning segment
