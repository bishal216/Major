Chapter 2: Profession &Ethics 
 
2.1 Profession definition 
• Systematic knowledge and skill acquired through specialized training or education 
• Synonym to job or occupation 
• Helps to provide specialized type of service for the needy person, organization, community  
 
2.2 Charateristics/Features of Profession 
• Systematic knowledge and skill 
A profession is based on the systematic knowledge and study. Based on such a acquired knowledge and skill a professional delivers the services to the needy people and society. A four years of comprehensive study and practical works requires to become an engineer. 
• Authenticity & honor 
The professional possess special knowledge and skill. So, they are provided special rights and honor to carry out their professional work to the society. An engineer certifies the safety design of required components for the people. Professional provides specialized types of service to the people that they do not understand and hence the people offer honor to them 
• Public property & Public evaluation  
Professionals are honored in the society and are also a subject of public evaluation. People are always watching each and every professional’s behavior and practice. Hence, a professional’s activity usually becomes a matter of public evaluation. People always discuss about the practicing doctors or engineers and their behavioral approach on the society. 
• Bound by code of ethics 
Professionals are regulated by professional bodies through licensing, code of ethics and disciplinary procedures. Professionals are required to maintain high morale and high standard of behavior. They are not free to act as what they desire. 
• Professional culture 
With reference to the different socialization process (consider during the study period),the nature of the profession itself and the code of ethics developed by the concerned professional society do have their own professional culture. Every professional do have some set of behavior that are similar to the other person of the same profession. 
  
Factors affecting morale of professionals: 
In societies, some of the professionals are found losing their professionalism due to following reasons. ? Inadequate Salary: If the salary and fee provided to a professional is far low to meet their reasonable requirement, they may have difficulty in maintaining professional service to public so that s/he may try other way.  
• Defective social norms/values – labor honorin the society the dignity of labour is equivalent to nil : money has got a high value irrespective of the source, professionals are not able to show high moral standard ? Low morale of the self 
• Non implementation of the rules and regulation 
• Lack of political commitment 
Professional Engineering 
• Act of designing, composing, evaluating, advising, reporting, supervising 
• Safeguarding of life, health, property, public welfare 
• Application of engineering principles but not practicing as a natural scientist 
Engineering council act 2055 defines the engineering profession as the occupation which is done by the engineers 
The engineer according to council defined as a person having graduate degree in engineering from the institute recognized by the council

   Language & Competence Nepal Engineering Council 
• Nepal engineering council is an autonomous body formed under government act (NEC act 2054. It regulates engineering profession effectively and scientifically. It also undertakes licensing of engineering accordance with their qualification. 
Background 
• It can be said that Nepal entered a modern phase in engineering after the political change in the sixties. Engineering activities began to contribute to the development of the country and the engineering profession started to gain respect in the society. The engineering community began to grow in number and was involved in all spheres of national development and engineers were allowed to compete in administrative service also for the post of secretary. Furthermore, the introduction of democracy in 1990 encouraged the growth of engineering colleges in Nepal abd the enrolment of students into these engineering colleges was rising very fast. Hence it was expected that nearly 3000 engineers would be graduating from local engineering colleges every year with nearly an equal amount graduating from colleges abroad. So, a need was felt for an organization to manage the engineering profession. Therefore, to make the engineering profession more effective, Nepal Engineering Council was formed under the Nepal Engineering Council Act, 2055 promulgated by Nepal Government on B.S. 2055/11/27 (11th March, 1999 A.D.). As per the Act, NEC has been vested with the statutory authority for the planning, coordinated development and monitoring of engineering profession and education in the country. NEC Act 2055 gives an outline on the formation of the Council, its tenure and the roles and responsibilities of the Chairman, Vice Chairman and the Registrar. 
• Nepal Engineering Council Rules, 2057 has also been prepared and approved by Nepal Government as per the provision of Clause 37 of the Act. It defines the registration of engineers into three categories as well as the formats for application: 
a) General Registered Engineer 
b) Professional Engineer 
c) non - Nepali Registered Engineer 
• NEC Rules 2057 also lays down the professional code of conduct for engineers registered with the Council. The first Executive Council was formed on Magh 2056 under the chairmanship of Er. Ram Babu Sharma and completed its tenure on Magh 2060.

It is an independent non-profit organization of Nepalese engineers. It was established in 1968.Today, it represents more than 7500 engineers. Nepal Engineers Association office is located at Pulchowk behind UNDP building. NEA is governed by an executive body of 15 members elected by members of the association. As the democratically elected representative body of the profession, the Executive Council, supported by its various 17 committees decides major policy issues and NEA's overall direction. Members are encouraged to participate in the affairs of the association. The noble aim of developing engineering professionals to promote the development process by application of engineering sciences and technologies and at the same time increasing the interaction, goodwill and cooperation among engineers in Nepal and protect their professional rights.  
NEA was successful in expansion of in-country NEA centers, conversion of existing ones to Regional Centers as well as establishment of an international wing, NEA-Bangkok Center during the last decade. During the 

past decade, NEA broadened its activities by expanding its relation with international Engineering societies. NEA became member of World Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO) and was successful to establish Federation of Engineering Institute of South and Central Asia (FEISCA). During the 
past decade, NEA has been successful in construction of its own building at Pulchowk . The finished two floors have been rented out to Nepal Telecommunications Corporation.  
The NEA office at Jamal has been shifted to ground floor of NEA building at Pulchowk following demolition of the historic building housing NEA building during December 2001. The engineering community and wellwishers donated funds to complete the ground floor and basement of the existing NEA building. The basement has been hired out to Nepal Telecom. The ground floor is fully used by NEA. Rent revenue thus generated now goes directly in paying construction loans. The Jamal office has also been rented out. In the recent past, NEA has successfully promoted the enactment of Nepal Engineering Council Act. Today NEA has prepared a draft five-year strategy plan, which aims at upgrading current membership to internationally recognized standards. In this connection, a study on strengthening NEA is currently underway with support of Institution of Civil Engineers, UK and DFID.

Code of ethics for engineer adopted by NEA 
NEA Adopted code of ethics for its fellow since 2025. According to NEA, fundamental principle of professional engineering ethics is: 
• Upholding and advancing engineering profession 
• Keeping high standard of ethical conduct 
 
Qualities of engineers to adhere with above principles are: 
• Will be honest and fair and serve employer, clients and public 
• Will dedicated to the advancement of competence of engineering profession and to disseminate engineering knowledge 
• Will use his knowledge and skill in the service of humanity 
The code of ethics also directs the relationship of Nepalese engineer with public, employers & clients and fellow engineers.

Relationship of engineering profession to basic science and technology; relationship to other professions Engineering:  Application of knowledge and skills acquired through a specialized training, education and experiences and practicing the same as an occupation in the areas of public safety, health and property protection. In short it is a systematic application of knowledge and skill. 
The basic science: Study of law of nature, properties of matters and sources of power that are available around us.  
Technology:  Best application of those laws of nature and utilization of the properties of matters and sources of power by which, engineer can make new facilities and create new services. Basically the basic science and technology used in an integrated form as a separate profession for the welfare of people is engineering. So we concluded engineering knowledge is not possible without basic science and technology. 
Basic science and technology includes physics, chemistry, mathematics and technology includes those in which the process or method of applying those describes how to become or how to make. Combining both of these subjects forms engineering subjects. 
Engineering works involve large funds for creating facilities and services for the people. As the project involves budget and the people the engineer in charge and staff need to have good procedure of keeping record and rapport with stakeholders.  Therefore engineering profession involves mainly the following profession, accountant, lawyers, medicals and managers. Accountants keep records of expenditures, lawyers help in executing works within legal sphere, medical person helps in keeping people of engineering safe and healthy and managers help in sorting and executing works as per state rules and regulation and maintaining good relationship with other stakeholders without creating conflicts. 
Therefore, engineering profession has a deep relation with law, account, medicine, and management profession. Auditing, budgeting, managing conflicts and maintaining harmonies in work sphere are some of the professions with whom engineering profession has deep relationships. 
 
2.5 Ethics, code of ethics & engineering ethics Moral : 
• Concerned with goodness and badness of human character 
• Measures the standard of good behavior  by which people are judged 
• Standards of behavior  accepted by the culture and religion of the society 
• Basic human marker  of right conduct or behavior ; Free from action of nature and animal 
• Delve into right or wrong at much deeper level, which is both personal & spiritual 
• Made of  sterner (severe/harsh/firm/strict) stuff & usually do not change 
• Morals are of a subliminal (hidden / unconscious/Unintentional) nature & defines personal character  Ethics : 
Abstract: Set of guidelines that defined accepted practice & behavior for group of people/society.  
It can be changed according to the nation/society/peer group/religion/profession.  
It is not doing just the right things; also it is making tough decision about ambiguous things. Things that are legal may not be considered ethical. 
• Science of human character as expressed in right or wrong conduct for purposeful action: Science of morality 
• Science of ideal (truth, beauty, good) involved in human life; 
• system of belief that supports the view of morality 
• seeks to teach us how we can pass correct moral judgment upon human conduct and consider it as right or wrong with reference to supreme ideal of human life 
• Activity of understanding moral values, resolving moral issues, and justifying moral judgment 
• The particular set of belief, attitudes, and habits that a person or groups displays concerning morality ? Define the code, that a society / group of people adhere 
• Ethics that a person adheres too are impacted upon by external factors like nation /society/ religion/ profession & could change with change in any of those influencing factors 
• It is set of guidelines that define accepted practices & behavior for a certain group of people ? It relates to society & more in a professional life 
• It stress a social system in which those morals are applied 
• Ethics point to standards or codes of behavior expected by the group to which the individual belongs ? Ethics he or she practices can be other dependent 
Ethics and morals both relate to “right” and “Wrong” conduct. However, ethics refer to the series of rules provided to an individual by an external source e.g. their profession. On the other hand, morals refer to an individual’s own principles regarding right and wrong. 
Difference between Ethics and Morals 
	Subject  Matter 	 	 	 	Ethics   	 	 	 	 	Moral 
 The rules of conduct recognized in respect to Principles or habits with respect to right or 1. What is it? a particular class of human actions or wrong conduct. It defines how things should  particular group, cthing are according to the rulesulture etc. It defines how  work according to individuals’ ideals and principles 
 
2. What is the Source ? 	Social System/External 	Individual/Internal 
 
3. Why we do it ? 	Because society says it is the right things to do it 	Becausor wronge we believe in something being right  
	 	Doing something against one’s morals and 
4. What if we don’t do it ? We will face peer/societal disapproval or principles can have different effects on even fired from our job 
 	different 	people., 	they 	may 	feel  	uncomfortable, remorse (regret), depresetc. 	sed 
 
5. Flexibility 	Ethics 	are 	dependent 	on 	others 	for 	Usually consistent, although can change if an definition. They tend to be consistent within 	individual’s change 
 	a certain context but can vary between  	contexts. 
Actions neither moral nor immoral 
• Calamities 
• Animal actions 
• Children action/mad action/idiot action/drunkard action 
• Action under compulsion 
 
Code of ethics: 
Concept:  It expresses the rights, duties and obligation of its member. 
Code of ethics provides framework for ethical judgment for a professional 
Limitations: It is not a recipe for ethical behavior 
It is not a legal code 
It only deals with choices 
One may not be arrested if he/she disobeys code of ethics 
Code provides little space for an employer where he/she could fight against the employer’s request to behave unethically 
   Engineering Code of ethics :The study of moral values, issues and decision involved in engineering practice 
Why : How technical works impact on society ? 
Should study ethics because they need to get sensitized to ethical issues before they are confronted with professional problem. Past experience may help us to increase our sensitivity to ethical problem which show us to find sound solutions  
Objective 
The ethics as normative science of any professional conduct needs codes of ethics and guidelines to maintain high level of standard of good behaviour or conduct in the public. Engineers create facilities and services by any or all of the acts and do so by applying engineering principles and the experiences gained. 
 
Summary of engineering code of ethics 
• Code provides a positive stimulus/motivation for ethical conduct and a set of guidelines with fundamental canon/norms  
• Code gives a positive support to those seeking to act ethically and in taking stands on moral issues when a professional in under pressure to act unethically 
• Code serves as legal support for professional 
• Codes also serve the formal basis for investigating unethical conduct 
• The current codes are by no means perfect, but they are steps in the right direction 
• A code of ethics governs the conduct of all practitioners 
• It endures that engineers practice within their realm of expertise, they do so in a fair and ethical manner and they place the good of society above their personal gain 
• Means by which engineers govern themselves 
• It is privilege earned over the years through knowledge, experience and trust Core ethical values of engineering code : 
• Honesty 
• Integrity 
• Fidelity 
• Charity 
• Responsibility 
• Self-Discipline 
 	 
 	The core concept to be found among the various engineering code, in order of significance are 
1. The public interest 
2. Quality of truth, honesty, and fairness 
3. Professional performance 
 	 	 
 	Limitation of engineering code  
1. Codes are not straight forwardly applicable to all situation. More problems can arise in a complex profession like engineering. 
2. It is easy for different entries in codes to come in to conflict with each other that may create moral dilemmas. 
3. A code cannot serve as the final moral authority for professional conduct.  	Fundamental canons of ethics issued by NSPE 
The national society of professional Engineers NSPE US approved by the board of directors on 5th Oct 1977 has set the following fundamental principles9canons) for engineers to support and advance the integrity, honor and dignity of engineering profession by 
1. Using their knowledge and skill for the advancement of human welfare  
2. Being honest and impartial and serving with loyalty the public, their employers and clients. 3. Striving to increase the competencies and prestige of engineering profession 
4. Supporting the professional and technical societies of their disciplines. 
Professional ethics concerns the moral issues that arise because of the specialist knowledge that professionals attain, and how the use of this knowledge should be governed when providing a service to the public.

2.6 Moral dilemma & ethical decision making  
Dilemma: A situation necessitating a choice between two equally unpleasant/ undesirable alternatives. A problem that seems incapable of solution. 
Moral Dilemma:  A painful decision, where every solution involves some kind of loss is a moral dilemma. It is even worse, because whichever option you chose, someone or something will suffer. Decision has to be made on the morally correct course of action, not just the one you would prefer.  
The engineers / professionals need to overcome the moral dilemma considering following law of ethics: 
5. Eternal  	 	– based on nature and the scriptures, common sets of moral standards are set 
6. Utilitarianism   	– greatest amount of benefit for the largest no. of people 
7. Universalism    	- everyone faced with same set of circumstances 
8. Distributive justice  	– a belief in the primary of justice 
9. Personal liberty  	– value of liberty, primacy of single value 
Discussion on moral (ethical) dilemma on decision making taking reference of laws of ethics 
In every pace of life, ethical dilemma happens on decision making process. Ethical dilemma happens on decision making process happens due to economic and social reasons for an institution and want or desire and duties for an individual.

On the basis of moral value, society can distinguish the good and bad things. The aim of manager need to create an ethically healthy climate for his or her employees, where they can do their work productively and confront a minimal degree or ambiguity regarding what constitutes right wrong behaviour. 
The aim of ethics is to define the nature of the highest good of a man as a member of society. Problems faced by a manager was examined in great detail to consider in detail the actual nature of the ethical dilemma in management and from that examination five conclusions were drawn concerning the complexity of managerial ethics. Ethical problems in management are complex and ethical decisions have: 
1. Extended consequence 
2. Multiple alternative 
3. Mixed outcomes 
4. Uncertain consequences 
5. Personal implications 
1. Extended consequence: most ethical decision have extended consequences. The decisions of manager have an impact upon others; both within the organisaion and within society; that is beyond their control and therefore should be considered when the decisions are made. For example bribe (backhander) change governmental process, pollution affects environmental health, unsafe products destroy individual lives. 
2. Multiple alternatives: Most ethical decision decisions have multiple alternatives. Should a manager pay a bribe or not? Should a factory pollute the air or not? Should a company manufacture unsafe product or not? As has been seen in the simple illustration of bribery payments for import clearances. Multiple alternatives have to be considered in making ethical choices. 
3. Mixed outcomes: most ethical decisions have mixed outcomes. Ethical issues in management are considered antithetical (negating). Pay an indirect bribe, but maintain the sales volume of imported goods through prompt delivery. Cause some air or water pollution, but avoid the cost of installing and operating pollution control equipment. Design a slightly unsafe product, but reduce the material and labour costs of manufacture. Social benefits and costs as well as financial revenues and expenses are associated with almost all of the alternatives in ethical choices. 
4. Uncertain consequences: Most ethical decisions have uncertain consequences. It is commonly thought that ethical issues in management are free of risk or doubt, with a known outcome for an alternative. Pay the bribe, and receive the imported goods promptly. Investment in pollution control equipment, and the emission will be reduced X% at Y costs of operation. Produce an absolutely safe product at an additional costs Z dollars per unit. It is not all clear what consequence will follow from most ethical choices. 
5. Personal implications: Most ethical decisions have personal implication. It is commonly thought that ethical issues in management are largely impersonal. Many people believe that prima facie ethical decision in a given operation may reduce the profits of the company but not the executive’s salaries or their opportunities for promotion. Maintain the sales of imported goods at expected levels, and despite slightly increased expenses for bribes, the quarterly review will be pleasant. Delay installation of pollution control equipment, and the rate of return will be close to the planed percentage. Redesign the product to reduce the material and labour cost, profit margin and chances of promotion will increase. Individual benefits and costs as well as financial social benefits and costs associated with most of the alternatives in ethical decisions.

The law expects certain standard of behavior from the citizen it governs. When a person fails to meet these standards by acting in a way the law considers unreasonable that person may be guilty of negligence. 
Negligence is the lack of proper care or intention. 
Elements of Negligence: 
In order to plaintiff to win damages, the attorney must establish in the following three elements. 
• The defendant had a legal obligation to behave in a certain way “duty of care” 
• The defendant failed to fulfill this obligation by acting inappropriately “ Breach of that expectation” 
• The plaintiff’s injury (loss/damage) was caused because of defendants legal breach of conduct “Resulting damage” 
Once these three critical statements are determined to be the case the court may offer compensation to the injured victim of negligence. 
Tort: It is an action or inaction of one or more individuals, which leads to loss or damage of another. The court seeks compensate to those who suffers as a result. This is independent of any contract that might exist. It is any private or civil wrong (other than breach of contract) for which damage may be claimed. Objective of Tort law: 
• Compensation to victim 
• Transferring the cost of injury from victim to the person responsible for that 
• Prevention of repetition of harmful action 
• Defending the law and rights of victim Grounds to bring tort cases in the court: 
• Negligence 
• Intentional wrong 
• Strict liability 
	Liability: 	-  	It is the obligation to pay penalty for fulfilling or not fulfilling predefined duties. 
- It is the consequences of negligence 
- Professionals can be liable for incorrect advice, design or reports 
Vicarious Liability:A person who commits tort is liable for the damage that he caused. Another person may also be liable in respect of the same tort even though he did not commit it. This can arise when an employee commits a tort in the course of his employment: his employer is also liable for his employee, which is known as vicarious.  
 
Liability of Partners in Tort:All the forms of partners are liable for a tort committed by a partner who committed tort. In the ordinary course of the firms business or with the expressed or implified authority of his copartners, such liability arises on the basis of vicarious liability because each partner is the agent of his co partners. Hence lawyers sue everybody they can find. If one of the parties is unable to pay the share the other parties will be expected to cover the short fall.  Types of liability: 
• Liability under contract: e.g. works not meeting specification 
• Liability in tort: For causing injury to others through negligence and reckless action 
• Liability under statute: In accordance with the laws and statute
