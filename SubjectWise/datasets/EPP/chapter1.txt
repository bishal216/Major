1.1 Man & Society 
The term society is derived from the Latin word “socius” which means companion, associate, comrade or business partner. It indicates that man lives in company of other people. Man is a social animal. It is difficult to live without society. No infant could reach maturity without the care of other people. According to MacIver, family was the first form of the society. Society means collection of individuals united by certain relations or modes of behavior which make them off from others who do not enter into these relations.  
Aristotle said “Man is a social animal”. Man needs society for his living, working and enjoying life. Society refers to the group of people, but to the complex pattern of the norms of interaction that arise among them. For the health of society it is essential that there must be a like-minded and unlike minded people. Likeness brings recognition whereas unlike mindness helps in generating new ideas. Invisible likeness and active cooperation is the backbone of society. Man forms the society and develops standard and norms. 
The world system is a network of many nations and societies. A society is an organization of people who share a common territory, govern themselves, and cooperate to secure the survival of the group. Not all societies are nations; there may be several societies within a single nation. Nepal and India share the society of Hindus. Iraq and Iran share the society of Kurds. The presence of many societies within a single nation can become a source of serious conflicts and sometimes war. 
Although nations may contain several societies, not all these societies are necessarily equal in power or benefit equally from social, political, and economic arrangements. For example, The Kurds in Iraq were oppressed by a more powerful prevailing society under late Suddam Hussein. And although blacks in South Africa are now in political majority, for many years they were exploited and oppressed economically, socially, and politically by the dominant white society in that country. 
Definition of society 
Society has been defined differently by different scholars. 
According to Giddings – “Society is the union itself, the sum of formal relations which associating individuals are bound together” 
J.F.Cuber has defined society, as a group of individuals who have lived together long enough to become organized and consider themselves distinct from others. 
Most appropriate definition of the term society given by Maclver is that “The society is the system of usages and procedures, of authority and mutual aid, of many groupings and divisions of controls of human behaviors and liberties. It is the web of social relationship”. 
Society gives content, direction, and meaning to our lives, and we in turn, in countless ways, reshape the society that we live to the next generation. Sociology is the scientific, or academic, study of society and human behavior. 
Society (definition summary): 
• Group of People(collection of individuals) 
• Sharing common territory/boundary of a country 
• Sharing common rules/regulation (government) 
• Sharing common culture/belief/value 
• Considered as a stable institution 
• A formal association of people with similar interests 
• The state of being with someone 
 
Elements of Society: 
• Plurality (male/female/young/old) 
• Differences (opinion/gender/interest) 
• Dynamic(changeability/inherit quality) 
• Interdependence (Like mother & baby) 
• Cooperation(like in family,friendship) 
• Likeness(Blood/nationality) 
• Mutual understanding/interaction,/awareness 
• Social control/Stability 
• Culture(traditions, activities, values) 
Social structure/Social needs 
To survive, every society must successfully address the same fundamental social needs. Talcott Parsons identified six basic fundamental social needs as follows: 
1. All societies must organize the activities of the members to obtain the basic goods and services necessary for survival (such as food, clothing, shelter, fuel, potable water).  
2. Societies must protect their members from both external and internal threats. External threats includes invasion by other societies and destructive natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes. Internal threats include crime like robbery, murder, rape and health epidemics like AIDS, measles, polio, and the flu. 
3. All societies must replace members lost by death or emigration. 
4. Whenever societies gain new members, they must transmit knowledge of the rights, obligations, responsibilities, and expectations of appropriate behavior to the new members. New members must also be taught the skills they will need to participate as productive member of the society. 
5. All society must motivate both new and continuing members to fulfill their responsibilities and conform to expected behaviors. 
6. Finally, societies must develop mechanisms for solving conflicts.  
 
Social Structure / Social needs : Summary 
For the survival, every society must address some fundamental needs. On this regard Talcott Parsons (American sociologist) identified six basic fundamental social needs. 
• Organizing the activities ( to obtain  basic goods & services –food/clothing/shelter/fuel/water) ? 	Protection  (of members from external & internal threats) 
• Replacement(of members lost by death or immigration) 
• Transmission (of knowledge to the new members- regarding :rights/obligation/responsibilities/expectation) 
• Motivation (to both new & continuing members to fulfill their responsibility & confirm to expected behavior)  ? 	Development ( of mechanism for solving conflicts) 
Social Institutions 
Five basic institutions can be found in all known societies. They are: the family, religion, economy, education, and the state. Each institution is intended to address one or more of the basic needs determining society’s survival.  
Institutions may even provoke or exacerbate systemic inequalities between groups within society. For example, when the U.S. went to war against Iraq in early 1991, the state was fulfilling its function of protecting U.S. society from external threats. Indeed, President Bush argued that it was necessary to go to war “to protect our way of life”, because Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait threatened U.S. access to Mideast oil.  
1. The Family: The family is the institution whose manifest function is to contribute new members to society. Family also teaches the new members what is expected of them, and they try to motivate members to fulfill those expectations. Families may reinforce race, gender, and class inequalities in the way they transmit expectations regarding appropriate behaviors and goals. 
2. The Religion: Religion manifestly motivates members to comply with their responsibilities and obligations by assigning meaning and purpose to such activities. Religion attempts to reinforce the family’s transmission of appropriate behaviors and goals to new members of society, and it parallels the family’s role as a mechanism of conflict resolution. 
3. The Economy: In U.S. the institutions of the economy includes corporations, organized markets, the banking community, international trade associations, labor unions, and consumer organizations. The purpose of economic institutions is primarily to produce and distribute goods and services throughout society. They also discipline and motivate members of society to perform their role in the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. 
4. Education: The manifest function of education is to transmit the skills that all young members of society need to become productive members of the economy as adults. Educational institutions can also be powerful mechanisms for social change. When skills taught by school include independent, critical, and creative thinking, they produce the potential for challenges to society to alter inequalities and discrimination. 
5. The State: State protects society’s members from both external and internal threats. The state also establishes penal and codes to formally define standards of acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, responsibilities and obligations, and it specifies sanctions for violations of these standards. Finally, the state aid the economy by developing social welfare programs that distribute goods and services to individuals the economy can not support. By enhancing the ability of the poor to consume goods and services, state directly support the private producers and the economy. The state may reinforce other inequalities as well.  
 
Social Institutions summary: Five Basic Institutions can be found in all known societies, which are enumerated below. 
• Family 
• Religion 
• Economy 
• Education 
• State – Politics, Warfare, Art & Leisure Types of societies 
Thousands of societies have existed on this planet since time immemorial. But these societies have been classified into a limited member of basic types depending on the technologies they adopted exploit the natural environment. The existence of present day societies has a trend of socio-cultural evolution. Different societies have used different subsistence strategies while exploiting the food resources. Types of societies are as follows: 
       1. Tribal societies 	4. Agricultural societies 
       2. Pastoral societies 	5. Industrial societies 
       3. Horticultural societies  	 Tribal societies 
A few thousand years ago, human being relied on hunting and gathering for their survival. This was the subsistence strategy of these societies. Even today one can find this handful of isolated people living in the Australian deserts and in the deep interiors of India. Their needs are simple and easily satisfied spending less time working for their food than the average inhabitants of any other type of society. The family is the only defined institution in these societies.  
Tribal societies have common territory, a sense of unity, common language, blood relationship, endogamous (customs permitting a man to marry within the tribe), worship common god. A tribal is a primitive society which existed in the early period of human history. Each tribe knows the norms and standards of behavior and is watched that younger learn the proper way of behaving. 
Pastoral societies 
Some ten to twelve thousands years ago a few hunting and gathering tribal started domestication of herds of animals. This strategy of subsistence (existence) gave birth to pastoral societies. They usually believe in a god or gods who take an active interest in human affairs and look after the people who worship them. A few religions such as Judaism (the religion of the Jewish people), Christianity and Islam originated among pastoral people.  
Horticultural societies 
These societies specialize in the domestication of plants which they cultivate manually with hoes. Horticulture became necessarily alternative to pastoral people. Horticulture provided an assured supply of food and surplus that enabled some individuals wealthy and more powerful than others. Many horticultural societies are still in existence in Africa, Asia, South America and Australia. 
Agricultural societies 
The agricultural wealth of the society was unevenly distributed with a small majority of people enjoying the surplus produce by the working society. Political institutions were more elaborated. Power was concentrated in the hands of a single individual and heredity monarchy prevailed. The religions of agricultural societies often include a belief in a ‘family’ of gods. One of these is a high god regarded as more powerful god than other god. Trade is more elaborated in agricultural society. Money is used as medium of exchange. Agricultural societies tend to be at war constantly. These conditions create the need of military set up. The need for efficient communication and transportation was developed in these large societies.  
Industrial societies 
Application of scientific knowledge to the technology of production is the basis of industrial society. Industrial revolution gave birth to industrial societies. New technologies – such as steam engine, electrical power tend to bring about social change. This society produced bulk quantity to feed the majority. This society was found practicing a new system of production and distribution. Division of labor in factories and in management predominates in industrial society. Growth and development of trade unions is also an important characteristic of industrial society.   Types of societies - summary: 
 
• Tribal Societies (From 2 million to Thousands years before)  – lived as Hunters & gatherers / no permanent settlement /needed several hundred square miles of territory/ constantly on the move for new food supply/ used to take food directly from environment rather than maintaining gardens, fields or domesticated  animals / family is the only defined institution 
• Pastoral societies  (Ten to Twelve thousands years before)  -categorized  by  domestication of herds of animals/ typically found in mountainous region and in areas with insufficient rainfall to support horticultural & agricultural societies/ family  & religion are major two institution which was appeared in this society/Slavery is more common in this society 
• Horticultural societies(developed between 13000 to 7000 B.C.) – produce food by gardening (domestication of plants)/ cultivate manually/ this society was occurred due to large declination of animals/ the gardens were usually made by clearing(slash and burn) a forested area and planting the crops/ the people in this society used to move on to make new gardens as the forest reclaimed the garden and the soil lost nutrients (no plow system)/ family,economy religion are the major social institutions exists in this society/ slavery is fairly common 
• Agricultural (Agrarian) societies(6000 years ago) – plow was invented/ maintained the fertility of the soil by turning top soil using plow/ first society to develop city/ permanent settlements /Trade elaborated/money used as medium of exchange/ all the social institutions (family, religion, economy, politics, education, art & leisure ,warfare) was developed more elaborately & move towards complexity  
• Industrial societies(280 year before)– characterized by use of machine rather than animals including human / planet’s first industrial society was England / majority of people live in urban areas rather than rural settings / all the social institutions (family, religion, economy, politics, science, education, art & leisure ,warfare) was developed more elaborately & move towards complexity / Industrial revolution gave birth of industrial societies/ production & distribution,  establishment of trade unions 
Social Change: 
• Change in the society due to alteration in patterns of culture, social structure and social behavior over time ? 	Dynamic and ongoing process 
• Progressive transformation of society 
• Subject to constant change 
• MacIver: Change in the human relationshipM.P. Jenson: Modification in ways of doing and thinking of people 
 
Factors causing social change: 
• Cultural innovation – innovation, discovery and diffusion/pattern of culture, social structure, social behaviour 
• Technology – Use of computer, mobiles/ kitchen gadgets to automobiles  
• Geography – Oceans/deserts/mountain ranges/jungles 
• Environment – Hurricanes/Landslides/Fires/ Earthquake/Greenhouse effect 
• Population- Significant decrease or decrease in population size or growth rates  may disrupt social 
life 
• Human actions - Ideas/opinion/social conflicts/social movements/invasion  
1.2 Technology& Society 
The term technology refers to how input is transferred to output. Technology is a systematic knowledge which facilitates in the use of machines and tools. One of the most distinctive of all human characteristics is that men are tool-using animals. People have used increasingly sophisticated techniques to act on the social and the natural world for thousands of years and they have done so in many ways that have transformed, and continue to transform, the very conditions of life on this planet.  
Over the generations, simple tools and machines made by human beings such as the knife, the wheel, the plough, the compass, the clocks, the printing press, the steam engines, the nuclear reactors, the computer, the mobile phones, etc have dramatically influenced our social and natural surroundings. These all are the examples of technologies, the practical application of scientific or other knowledge. 
Technology and social change are intimately connected, particularly in the modern world, where rapid technological and social change tends to go hand in hand. Many people in modern societies seem to implicitly assume that technological development and human progress is much the same thing.      Technology - summary: 
• Part of knowledge that deals with the creation and use of technical means and their interrelation with life, society, and the environment, drawing upon such subjects as industrial arts, engineering, applied science, and pure science. 
• Practical application of systematic knowledgeusing machine and toolsresulting high productivity and higher efficiency for the satisfaction of requirements  such as utility, usability & safety

Technical change: 
• Modification 
• Alteration Achieved from Information, Technique &Tools 
• Innovation 
Technology and social change are intimately connected, particularly in the modern world, where rapid technological and social change tends to go hand in hand. Many people in modern societies seem to 
implicitly assume that technological development and human progress is much the same thing Impact & consequences of technology on society: 
Technological development(Media Player/Mobile) 
• Economics & Technological development ( earlier – occasional & spontaneous exchange of goods & services) 
• Values (Change in expectation & realities/ Mechanistic world view, Efficiency, Social progress) 
• Ethics- According to Winston , four major ethical implications of technological development are (a)Challenges traditional ethical norms  (b)Creates an aggregation of effects (c) Changes the distribution of justice (d)Provides great power 
• Lifestyle – a) simplifications of life : rise of leisure class/ quick responses to events & trends /global networking/cheaper prices/specialization in jobs 
b) complications of life :Pollution /Congestion /New forms of danger /New forms of entertainment/increased probability of some diseases & disorders/social separation of singular human interaction 
• Institutions and groups: (Rise of very large organizations e.g. government, the military other welfare institutions) 
• International: Enables wider knowledge of international issues, values and cultures due to mass transportation & mass media/ World seems to be much smaller place due to globalization of ideas,  embeddedness  of value, population growth & control  & others among other reasons ) 
• Environment : Obvious (depletion of nonrenewable natural resources such as petroleum, coal, ores) 
   & Subtle (global warming, deforestation, natural habitat destruction, loss of coastal wetland)/technological waste – no such mechanism exists for the removal Influence of technical change on society: 
• Mass production of goods through machines 
• Mass communication 
• Faster means of transportation 
• Faster pace of life 
• Automation 
• Availability of labour saving devices 
• Commercialized recreation 
• Emphasis on high degree of specialization Technological change & family system:

• Analysis of religious doctrines & traditions 
• Rigidity in caste system has been relaxed 
• Men are free from religious ritual  
• Religion has become secondary thing  not a primary one Technological change &rural life: 
• Migration towards urban areas 
• Increase in consciousness of rural people 
• Life become comfortable than before 
• Change in life pattern 
Technological change & Urban Life: 
• Shortage of land and houses  
• Increase in slums 
• Problem of transportation 
• Increase in crimes 
• Expensive life 
• Money has become the most important thing 
• Lack of security 
Theories of social change: 
1) Socio-cultural evolution theory: 
Evolutionary process implies that societies would necessarily reach new and higher level of civilization. Socio-cultural evolution theory is based on the assumption that societies gradually develop from simple beginnings into ever more complex forms. This assumption rests on both anthropological and historical evidence. Evolution theory assumes that social change occurs for betterment. Many simple societies like tribal, pastoral, horticultural, and agricultural societies have grown steadily larger, and some of them have been transformed into the industrial and postindustrial societies of the modern world.  
Summary 
• Developed from simple beginning into ever more complex forms (horticulturist /hunters) 
• Assumption based on anthropological/historical evidence 
• Influence of Charles Darwin’s organic evolution 
• Evolutionary process implies that societies would necessarily reach new & high level of civilization 2) Functionalist  theory: 
Talcott Parsons argued that a society consists of interdependent parts each of which helps to maintain the stability of the entire social system which has a tendency to seek equilibrium and balance. Parsons viewed that social change occurs when internal or external strains such as unemployment or war through the system out of balance. This imbalance provokes adjustments that help bring the system back into equilibrium once more built the new equilibrium establishing different social arrangements and cultural components than the previous one.  
Imbalances means system has to adjust to new equilibrium. In short, social change is simply a means of getting from one form of social stability to another. Movement of traditional societies from traditional to industrialization is an example of social change. Emile Durkheim laid the basis for functionalism. This theory has emphasized social order rather than social change.  
Summary 
• Developed from simple beginning into ever more complex forms (horticulturist /hunters) 
• Assumes that society consist of interdependent parts, each of which helps to maintain the stability of the entire social system 
• Social change occurs when internal or external strain such as unemployment or war throws the system out of balance 3) Conflict  theory: 
Conflict theory was developed by Karl Marx and has been modified and developed by later sociologists. Conflict theory of social change holds that many changes are caused by tensions between competing interests in the society. Conflict theorists regard conflict as inevitable and normal process. This theory assumes that the existing social conditions always contain the seeds of new social change. Based on the condition of economic production, the form of society is defined as: primitive socialist, slave, feudal, capitalist, socialist and finally communist society. 
Summary 
• Developed by Karl Marx &later developed by sociologist 
• Social change is the result of the conflicts between classes existing in the society 
• Different classes of different interest 
• Classes are fundamentally on the economy based 
• Based on the condition of economic production 
• The form of society can be defined as socialist/slave/feudal/capitalist/communist 4) Cyclical theory: 
This theory assumes that each civilization is like a biological organism and has a similar life-cycle: birth, maturity, old age and death. Each society faces challenges at first from environment, internal enemies, external enemies etc. The nature of response determines the fate of society. The achievements of the civilization consist of its successful responses to challenges, if it cannot mount an effective response it dies. 
Summary 
• Focus on the rise & fall of civilization attempting to discover & account for these pattern of growth & decay  
• Assumes that each civilization is like a biological organism & has a similar life cycle/birth/maturity/old age & death 
• Each society faces challenges at first from environment/internal enemies/external enemies 
Community 
When the members of a group live together and share no particular interest but the basic condition of common life. Man cannot live in isolation. Man is linked in many ways to his fellows in many ways who form a group. By living together for years in a definite part of territory, a sort of relation with people or social likeness is established. This fact of social living, likeness among these in specific area gives birth to community. Community is a cluster of people living with a narrow territorial radius, who share a common way of life.  
According to Bogardus, community is “a social group with some degree of feeling and living in a given area”. Blaire and Meeca said, “A human community is a functionally related aggregate of people who live in a particular geographic locality at a particular time, share a common culture, are arranged in a social structure, and exhibit an awareness of their uniqueness and separate identity as a group”. According to Ginsberg, “Community is a group of social being living a common life including all the infinite variety and complexity of relations which result from that common life or constitute it”. 
Elements of community 
Followings are the elements of community: 

1. A community is essentially the group of people sharing the common feeling and basic conditions of a common life. 
2. Group of people residing in a definite locality form a community. It occupies a territorial area. 
3. Feeling of community sentiments is another important characteristic of a community. It means a feeling of belonging together. In cities and towns feeling of sentiments lacks drastically. In village one can still find feeling of community sentiments. 
4. Unlike crowd, community is of permanent nature. 
5. Community is not created and made by an act of will but its emergence is quite natural. 
6. Likeness in language and customs is significant elements of community. 
7. Ends and objectives of community are wider and natural not artificial. 
8. A community has no legal status. It can neither sue nor to be sued. 
9. Every community has some specific and particular name.
