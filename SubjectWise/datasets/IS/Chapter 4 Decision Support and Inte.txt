Chapter 4 Decision Support and Intelligent System
4.1 Decision Support System
• Decision support system (DSS) is a computer based information system that supports organizational decision making activities.
• A decision support system (DSS) is a computer program application that analyzes business data and presents it so that users can make business decisions more easily.
• It helps to make decisions about unstructured and semi-structured problems.
• A properly designed DSS is an interactive software-based system intended to help decision makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data, documents, and personal knowledge, or business models to identify and solve problems and make decisions.
Based on relationship with user
1. Passive DSS
• It is a system that aids the process of decision making but that can not bring the explicit decision solutions.
2. Active DSS
• It is a system that is able to bring explicit decision solutions for a problem.
3. Cooperative DSS
• It is a system that allows iterative process between human and system to achieve best solution.
Based on Mode of Assistance
1. Communication driven DSS
• It enables cooperation, supporting more than one person working on a shared task.
2. Data driven DSS
• It emphasizes access to and manipulation of a time series of internal company data and, sometimes, external data.
3. Document driven DSS
• It manages, retrieves, and manipulates unstructured information in a variety of electronic formats.
4. Knowledge driven DSS
• It provides specialized problem-solving expertise stored as facts, rules, procedures, or in similar structures.
5. Model driven DSS
• It emphasizes access to and manipulation of a statistical, financial, optimization, or simulation model.
Components of DSS
1. Database:
• It is a well organized collection of current and historical data from a number of applications and groups.
• It provides easy access to data and information from variety of applications.
• It is able to maintain data integrity.
• The data are extracted from various relevant databases and stored especially for decision support system only.
2. Model:
• A model represents an abstract representation of different components and relationships of a phenomenon.
• The model can be classified as:
(a) Behavioral Model
(b)Management Science Model
(c) Operation Research Model
3. User Interface:
• It allows interaction between the user of the system and the DSS database and model.
• The user interface is responsible to deal with the end user of the system providing them with friendly interface.


Behavioral Model:
• It focuses on studying and understanding the trends among the variables.
• It tends to find the correlation and regression among the variables.
Management Science Model:
• It is based on the principle of management and accounting.
• It includes budget system, cost accounting, inventory management and so on.
Operations Research Model:

• It represents the different real life problems depending on the various variables and parameters in the form of algebraic expressions.
• Eg: linear programming, material requirement planning, mathematical programming techniques and so on.
Analytical Model of DSS:
• It focuses on identifying the problem and implementing the solution.
• The steps in analytical model of DSS are as follows:
1. Problem identification
2. Define objectives
3. Pre-decision.
4. Generate alternatives
5. Evaluate alternatives
6. Make a choice
7. Implement choice

4.6 Data Mining and Data Warehousing
What is Data Mining?
• Data mining is the process of finding patterns in the given set of data.
• It is also defined as the process of extracting information from huge sets of data.
• Such patterns generally provides some meaningful information to the intended users.
• It uses statistical analysis.
• The applications of data mining are as follows:
1. Market analysis
2. Fraud detection
3. Customer retention
4. Production control
What is Data Warehousing?
• Data warehousing is the process of aggregating data from multiple sources into a common repository.
• Data warehouse is a database which is kept separate from the operational database, which basically consists of consolidated historical data.
• A data warehouse helps executives to organize, understand, and use their data to take strategic decisions.
• The features of a data warehouse are as follows:
1. Subject oriented
2. Integrated
3. Time variant
4. Non-volatile
Relation of Data Mining and Data Warehousing:
• Data warehousing is the process in which the data from different sources are aggregated to a single database.
• Data mining is the process of analyzing the data stored in the data warehouse to generate some meaningful patterns.
• Data mining is the process that is incomplete without data warehousing.
• The general flow of data analysis is:
Data from different source ====> Data warehouse =====> Data mining =====> Useful patterns
Necessity of Data Warehousing
A data warehouses is kept separate from operational databases due to the following reasons:
1. An operational database is constructed for well-known tasks and workloads such as searching particular records, indexing, etc. In contract, data warehouse queries are often complex and they present a general form of data.
2. Operational databases support concurrent processing of multiple transactions.Concurrency control and recovery mechanisms are required for operational databases to ensure robustness and consistency of the database.
3. An operational database query allows to read and modify operations, while a data warehouse query needs only read only access of stored data.
4. An operational database maintains current data. On the other hand, a data warehouse maintains historical data.
4.7 OLAP and OLTP
On-Line Transaction Processing (OLTP):
• Online Transaction Processing is a information system type that prioritizes transaction processing, dealing with operational data.
• These systems gather input information and store them on a database, in a large scale.
• he main emphasis for OLTP systems is put on very fast query processing, maintaining data integrity in multi-access environments and an effectiveness measured by number of transactions per second.
• Eg: A banking transaction system
On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP):
• Online analytical processing is a computer technology term referring to systems focused on analysing data in a specific database.
• Example: In a hospital there is 20 years of very complete patient information stored. Someone on the administration wants a detailed report of the most common deseases, sucess rate of treatment, intership days and a lot of relevant data. For this, we apply OLAP operations to our data warehouse with historical information, and throught complex queries we get these results. Then they can be reported to the administration for further analysis.

Multi-dimensional views of various kinds of business activities
Periodic long-running batch jobs refresh the data
Often complex queries involving aggregations
Depends on the amount of data involved; batch data refreshes and complex queries may take many
hours; query speed can be improved by creating indexes
Larger due to the existence of aggregation structures and history data; requires more indexes than

To control and run fundamental business tasks


Reveals a snapshot of ongoing business processes


Short and fast inserts and updates initiated by end users


Relatively standardized and simple queries Returning relatively few records


Typically very fast


Can be relatively small if historical data is archived

Database Design
Backup and
Recovery

OLTP
Typically de-normalized with fewer tables; use of star and/or snowflake schemas
Instead of regular backups, some environments may consider simply reloading the OLTP data as a
recovery meth

Highly normalized with many tables


Backup religiously; operational data is critical to run the
business, data loss is likely to
entail significant monetary loss
and legal liability
