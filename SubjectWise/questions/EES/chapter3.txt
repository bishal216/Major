fuel electrode) must meet most of the same requirements as the cathode for electrical conductivity, thermal expansion compatibility and porosity, and must function in a reducing atmosphere."}{"question": "What is the ionic conductivity of the fuel electrode?", "answer": "Figure 3."}{"question": "What is the role of the interconnect?", "answer": "The interconnect functions as the electrical contact to the cathode while protecting it from the reducing atmosphere of the anode."}{"question": "What is the simplest example of a solid oxide electrode?", "answer": "7: Tubular Solid Oxide Electrolyte Once the molecular oxygen has been converted to oxygen ions it must migrate through the electrolyte to the fuel side of the cell."}{"question": "What is the need for interconnects?", "answer": "This means that the cells need to be connected together and a mechanism for collection of electrical current needs to be provided, hence the need for interconnects."}
