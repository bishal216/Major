{'question': 'What is the acceptability of a failure?', 'answer': 'The acceptability of the failure depends on the combination of the two.'}
{'question': 'What is the role of safety engineer?', 'answer': 'Far too often, rather than actually influencing the design, safety engineers are assigned to prove that an existing, completed design is safe.'}
{'question': 'What is the purpose of safety engineering?', 'answer': 'Most bridges are designed with redundant load paths, so that if any one structural member fails, the structure will remain standing.'}
{'question': 'What is the role of safety engineers?', 'answer': 'Safety engineers consider what undesirable events can occur under what conditions, and project the related accident risk.'}

{'question': 'What is the best way to do a cost benefit analysis?', 'answer': 'Assemble a business unit subject matter expert group to brainstorm potential costs and benefits of the change under consideration.'}
{'question': 'What are the costs of a system safety analysis?', 'answer': 'These costs include, but should not be limited to: Direct Costs • Actual capital investment • Any change in tax or licensing costs • Consulting fees (if applicable) • Subscription fees • Annual Maintenance Costs Indirect Costs • Initial and ongoing training • Changes in space or facility requirements (leasing costs) • Labor hours for implementation • Changes in utilities rates or transportation costs • Other downstream or cross-unit costs These costs should be calculated at current rates plus projected inflation/expansion costs and collated into a simple cost benefit analysis template.'}
{'question': 'What is the definition of system safety?', 'answer': 'The system safety philosophy is to be applied to complex and critical systems, such as commercial airliners, complex weapon systems, spacecraft, rail and transportation systems, air traffic control system and other complex and safety-critical industrial systems.'}
{'question': 'What is the exception to this conventional approach?', 'answer': 'The exception to this conventional approach is the way some large government agencies approach safety engineering from a more proactive and proven process perspective, known as "system safety".'}
{'question': 'What is the key to executing a cost benefit analysis?', 'answer': 'The key to executing a correct cost benefit analysis is rooted in quantifying foreseeable cost as well as the expected quantifiable positive cash flow over a set period of time.'}
{'question': 'What are the costs of a change in business model?', 'answer': 'These costs include "hard costs" (actual dollars spent) and "soft costs" (indirect dollars spent in other areas to support a change in business model, equipment or practices).'}
{'question': 'What is the key to cost benefit analysis?', 'answer': 'Learning to do a simple cost benefit analysis allows business leaders to decide whether making a capital investment or failure to make that capital investment represents more risk to the company.'}
{'question': 'What is the purpose of the system safety philosophy?', 'answer': 'The proven system safety methods and techniques are to prevent, eliminate and control hazards and risks through designed influences by a collaboration of key engineering disciplines and product teams.'}

{'question': 'What is the key to a good cost benefit analysis?', 'answer': 'Similar to the cost calculation, it is critical to be all inclusive in your approach to project benefits.'}
{'question': 'What is the most complete cost benefit analysis?', 'answer': 'The most complete will incorporate a full 10year model to accommodate the depreciation/amortization schedule of a capital investment, even if the horizon for the ROI is much shorter than 10 year.'}
{'question': 'What is the key to a cost benefit analysis?', 'answer': 'Some examples of benefits may be: • Increased output • Reduced inventory costs • Reduced labor cost • Reduced supply chain costs • Reduced taxes or fees Step Three: Incorporate Time to the Equation Cash flow is king in today’s business world.'}
{'question': 'What is the key to a cost benefit analysis?', 'answer': 'The key is collecting the discrete cost and benefit numbers, then place it in a template, generally in a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel, and determine the net result on cash flow over time.'}
{'question': 'What is the key to a good cost benefit analysis?', 'answer': 'Whichever model you choose, the key is doing the right preparation to ensure the numbers feeding your analysis bear a strong resemblance to actual cost.'}
{'question': 'What are some types of benefits that are harder to quantify than others?', 'answer': 'Some types of benefits are harder to quantify than others.'}
{'question': 'What are some of the ways to calculate the return on investment?', 'answer': 'Others include the "buckets" or itemize the areas that will experience significant cost or benefit over time.'}
